# realtime

An attempt to make a small library that supports realtime sync via http2 streaming.

This was something I made in an attempt to learn Go, streaming and a little bit of realtime. It is far from perfect or tested. TBH it might still make more sense to just use websockets if you plan on implementing realtime sync.
